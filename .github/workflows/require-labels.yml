          message: |
            One of the following labels is required: `breaking`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, `internal`.
            Our PR naming convention can help determine the correct label.
            `feat:` -> `enhancement`
            `fix:` -> `bug`
            `docs:` -> `documentation`
            `test:` -> `internal`
            `style:` -> `internal`
            `chore:` -> `internal`
            `refactor:` -> `enhancement` or `internal`

            Any change that breaks backwards compatibility should also be labeled as `breaking`.
