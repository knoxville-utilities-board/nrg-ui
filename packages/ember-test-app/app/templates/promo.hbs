          existing electric wires. Fiber cables will be underground where
          electric lines are underground, and overhead where electric lines are

        <p>The vast majority of KUB's fiber network will be connected to
          existing utility poles by KUB contractors. This work is minimally
          obstructive to traffic and customer property. This work does not
          require any digging or boring.</p>

        <p>In some cases, KUB and its contract crews will have to bore
          underneath the ground and roadways to lay the fiber. The boring
          process involves digging in existing right-of-ways, often near roads.
          We will use specialized equipment and follow industry baest practices
          to minimize disruptions and complete the project efficiently.</p>
