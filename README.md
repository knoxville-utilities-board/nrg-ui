# @nrg-ui

NRG UI is the design system maintained by the Knoxville Utilities Board. It is built on top of Bootstrap.

## Usage

While the collection of raw CSS is available for use by non-Ember applications, the [Ember addon](./packages/ember-core/README.md) provides a more integrated experience for Ember applications. To use the CSS in a non-Ember application, check the [design system](./packages/design-system/) for instructions.
